# LyrAIcs

![alt text](https://github.com/sophiakolak/LyrAIcs/blob/main/cover.png?raw=true)

A google collab notebook that uses machine learning to iteratively generate lyrics for a user-provided vocal melody, genre, mood, and story.

## Disclaimer 

At the time, openai (or as I call it, "closedAI") provided free access to GPT3. I posted my access token because YOLO (it's still there if you look at older versions...) but it doesn't work anymore, so the actual API call will fail unless you happen to have your own functional access token. I plan to replace this with a call to an open source model (probably hugging face bloom), but have not gotten around to it yet. 

## What's interesting? 

I created this notebook for a class (art and machine learning), and used it to create the lyrics for this project [LyrAIcs song/music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICepRQPOEZo). While working on the project, I came to see machine learning as an invaluable collaborator, but a worthless high-level decision maker. 

In other words, aesthetic taste is essential for curating the output of these models. This is (in my opinion) what allows for the creation of interesting art with machine learning. As such, the idea was to have a flexible (and simple) prompting technique for collaborative lyric writing. 

This entire README was written by GPT3 (just kidding). Goodbye!
